	README

These instructions refer to the package you are installing as
some-package.tar.gz.

Acronyms:
your-install-dir - The directory you choose for the installation
some-package - the package to install
your-mkspecs - qt configure mkspecs used to generate the qt sdk (libraries) for your target platform. It can be 
		found under mkspecs/qws/your-mkspecs in qt sdk e.g <QT-SDK>/mkspecs/qws/linux-arm-g++


Unpacking, Building, Installing and Running the Demo:
----------------------------------------------------
It is assumed that you have already built the qt embedded sdk needed for running qt on your target. If not, then you can build qt using http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Building_Qt

1.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already.

	$cd your-install-dir
	$tar xzvf some-package.tar.gz

    This creates the subdirectory some-package containing the files.

2.  Enter the package directory and configure the package:

	$cd some-package
	$qmake -spec qws/your-mkspecs

3.  To build the package and examples

	$make

4.  Copying the catalog_ti demo to the target filesystem

	$cp <your-install-dir>/examples/catalog_ti/catalog_ti <path/to/your/target/filesystem>

5.  Export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH on your target to get the qt libraries in path. 

	$export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/path/to/qt/lib/on/filesystem

6.  Running the demo on your target
	
	$catalog_ti -qws

7.  For more options running the demo, please refer to the Demo HELP.
	
	$catalog_ti -qws -h
	

Using a component in your project
---------------------------------

The directory your-install-dir/src includes all the source code for the
component. To use this component in your project:

1.  Add the following line

	include(your-install-dir/src/some-package.pri)

    to the project's .pro file.

2.  Run qmake on the project's .pro file.

This adds the package's sources and headers to the SOURCES and HEADERS
qmake variables respectively, and update INCLUDEPATH to contain the
package's src directory. Additionally, the .pri file may include some
dependencies needed by the package.

To include a header file from the package in your sources, you can now
simply use:

    #include <some-package.h>
